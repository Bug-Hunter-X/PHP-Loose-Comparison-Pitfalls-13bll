This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP programming related to loose comparisons. Loose comparisons (==) in PHP can lead to unexpected results due to type juggling.  The example highlights a scenario where comparing 0 and '0' yields different outcomes depending on whether strict comparison (===) is used.  The solution provides a corrected version emphasizing the use of strict comparison for reliable type checking.
